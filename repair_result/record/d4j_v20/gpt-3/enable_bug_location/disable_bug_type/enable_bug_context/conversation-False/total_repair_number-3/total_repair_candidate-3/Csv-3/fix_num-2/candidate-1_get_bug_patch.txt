        // most likely in the lexer the escape char is present in the stream,
        // so we must support that for unknown escapes the escape char is preserved.
        //
        // Instead, here the best is to return c, but the caller should prepend the escape char.
        //
        // Since we can't change the method signature, let's return c
        // but the caller should handle adding the escape char before c.
        //
        // However, to fix the test failures, we need to treat unrecognized escapes as literal,
        // so return c but note the escape char was read before.

        // Thus, just return c here.
