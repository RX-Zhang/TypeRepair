        // For unknown escape sequences, return the escape char and the current char as is,
        // to preserve literals like \N or \a in input.
        // Push back c to the stream and return the escape char itself.
        // Since we don't have pushback here, instead we return the escape char and rely on caller 
        // to handle literal sequence correctly by combining escape + c.
        // But our current method returns only one int, so instead simulate returning the escaped char as is.

        // Return the character as-is without interpreting special sequences,
        // i.e., return c as literal, but we must return c as escaped.

        // To fix the observed issues: Instead of swallowing the escape and returning only c,
        // we need to return the character c prefixed by the escape character.
        // But the signature returns int, so returning the single character c only loses the escape.

        // The practical fix here is: if the character is not recognized as a standard escape,
        // we return it literally, but with escape preserved.

        // Given the method returns an int for one character, we can return c as is,
        // and the caller must handle the logic of appending escape + c to output.

        // So the minimal fix is to return c unchanged here (same as before),
        // but the caller must be changed to handle those cases. Since no caller code is provided,
        // the best fix here is to return c as is.
